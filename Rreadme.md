  ## Retrieving Stock Price Data

  #### The first is `data.csv` which has:

  - **Observations**: 3204
  - **Columns**: 439
  - **Period:** 2010-01-04 to 2022-09-23
  - **Description**: Adjusted daily closing price, of companies listed on the [S&P 500 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies).

  If you want to update the data, you can run the script I made available in [this repository](https://github.com/LucianoBritis/Python-for-Finance/blob/main/Python%20Quant/getData.ipynb). Just make sure you have the packages properly installed.
